# FastAPI Simple Blog API

This project is a demonstration of building a simple RESTful API using FastAPI, featuring user authentication, authorization, CRUD operations for blogs, pagination, and sorting. The technology stack includes Python, FastAPI, Pydantic, MongoDB, and Docker.

## Project Overview

The primary objectives of this project were to showcase proficiency in FastAPI, implement user authentication and authorization with JWT, manage CRUD operations for blog data, and incorporate features such as pagination and sorting. The code adheres to best practices for code structure and API architecture.

## Technology Stack

- **Python:** The primary programming language.
- **FastAPI:** A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **Pydantic:** Used for data validation and settings management.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database used for storing blog data.
- **Docker:** Containerization for easy deployment and scalability.
